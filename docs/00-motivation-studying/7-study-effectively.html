<p>&quot;Studying&quot;.  Such a common word that it can be hard to know what it really means.  At Elewa we use a very simple and actionable definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Studying</strong>: Managing your limited resources to maximize learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these common complaints hint that some resource has run out. </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;There is only so much time in a day.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I can&apos;t focus today.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I&apos;m burnt out.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I just don&apos;t care anymore.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Figure it out yourself this time.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It&apos;s too hard.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I can&apos;t stay awake.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Time, motivation, concentration, social support, thinking power, energy, all of these are necessary to maximize learning and all of them can be used up.</p>

<h3 id="know-yourself">Know Yourself</h3>
<p>There is no single best way to study, everyone has their own unique limitations they need to balance.  A busy parent will have a very different balancing act than a full-time student, or a single lawyer.  </p>
<p>The first step to effective studying is to know your own situation.  Do you run out of time before motivation?  Do you stay motivated well after you can&apos;t think straight anymore?  Do you have perfect discipline, but still learn slower than your peers? Each of these cases will require a different strategy, and only you can figure out your own strategy.  It can be tricky but with enough reflection, trial, and error you can make it.  </p>
<p>You&apos;re not in this alone!  Don&apos;t hesitate to ask others for study tips, or to share your own.</p>

<h3 id="some-strategies">Some Strategies</h3>
<p>TL;DR -</p>
<ul>
<li>Always remember why you&apos;re doing this.</li>
<li>Have a clear vision of the skills you want to gain.</li>
<li>Keep your study sessions short, fun, and regular.</li>
<li>Organize your studying around a carefully constructed set of questions.</li>
<li>Focus on one new concept at a time, and learn it in it&apos;s real-world context.</li>
<li>Mix it up. Alternate regularly between different tasks.</li>
<li>Help your friends whenever they ask.  You&apos;ll both learn more this way.</li>
<li>Ask friends for help when you need it, but do respect their time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Study strategies in more depth, organized by the resource they help to manage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong>:<ul>
<li>Organize your study sessions around a well-formulated set of questions.</li>
<li>Learn to cut your losses.  The goal of studying isn&apos;t to make a working application, it&apos;s to learn. Becoming fixated on finding a bug or tweaking the UI can waste time you should be spending on your primary learning objectives.</li>
<li>Collect and familiarize yourself good learning resources ahead of time. A few comprehensive resources will serve you better than an ad-hoc collection of smaller ones and take less time to sort through. The style &amp; messages will be more consistent, and complete resources will make an effort to tie old concepts back into new ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>:<ul>
<li>Don&apos;t loose sight of why you are learning to code.</li>
<li>Keep your studying light and fun.</li>
<li>When something is discouraging, work on it in little pieces mixed in with something you like.</li>
<li>Keep a daily learning journal.  When you think you aren&apos;t getting anywhere you can look back on all the progress you&apos;ve made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/working-memory-how-you-keep-things-ldquo-in-mind-rdquo-over-the-short-term/" target="_blank">Working Memory</a></strong>:<ol>
<li>Keep your working memory clear: <ul>
<li>Use cognitive tools like clear code, good habits, useful diagrams, and careful planning to lighten the load on your working memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&apos;t try working on anything you can&apos;t hold in your head all at once:<ul>
<li>If you find there&apos;s too much going on for you to keep straight, you probably did a bad job with # 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&apos;t multi-task. &quot;Multi-Tasking&quot; is just very fast task switching. Every time you change your focus you lose context (&quot;what was I thinking?&quot;, &quot;What line was that?&quot;, &quot;Which method threw an error?&quot;, &quot;How did those two methods interact?&quot;). It can take over 20 minutes to get fully back into the game after even a tiny distraction.</li>
<li>Practice intentional thinking.  Whenever an thought, idea, or question pops into your mind take a moment to figure out if it&apos;s helpful for what you&apos;re doing <em>right now</em>. If it is, follow through with it. If it isn&apos;t, write it down somewhere and forget about it.  You&apos;ll get back to it later if it matters.  Over time this will become a habit and you&apos;ll notice your thoughts become less and less distracting.</li>
<li>(Working Memory and Cognitive Load are very closely related)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>:<ul>
<li>Keep your study space consistent and distraction-free, whatever that means for you.</li>
<li><em>Read, Diagram, Modify, Create</em>.  Don&apos;t dive right into applying new concepts from scratch.  Start by reading &amp; diagramming projects that feature your target concept.  Then create predictions about how a change will effect the application and implement that change, does it behave how you think it does?  Finally, try applying this concept in a new project you build from scratch.</li>
<li>Recognize when you are overloaded and take some time to find a new project, or isolate the concept you are studying with clear examples.  The best way to do this is to ask a fellow student or teacher for help.  You&apos;re only just learning to recognize the concept, you can&apos;t expect yourself to build quality examples just yet.</li>
<li>Make frequent connections to concepts you already understand. It&apos;s easier and more effective to build on existing knowledge than to learn new concepts from scratch.  You will learn faster and have better skill transfer in the long run.</li>
<li>Take a break and get some sleep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Social Support</strong>:<ul>
<li>Teach others - it will help you learn and earn you some good will for when you really get stuck.</li>
<li>Rely on others - regularly working together will help build strong collaboration and communication skills.  It will also make your study community stronger and more productive.</li>
<li>Respect others&apos; needs - Everything in moderation.  Pay attention to each others&apos; rhythms, don&apos;t  distract your study-buddies when they&apos;re being productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Concentration</strong>:<ul>
<li>Take a break and get some sleep.</li>
<li>Hyper-focus isn&apos;t the only way to learn.  If you feel yourself thinking a bit slower and day-dreaming about your work, this can be a very good thing! It&apos;s called <a href="https://staciechoice1010.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/focused-vs-diffused-mode/" target="_blank">Diffused Thinking</a>, when used properly it is a powerful learning and creative tool.  But it will take some effort to learn and recognize the difference between this and true day-dreaming.</li>
<li>Keep a short study plan by your side.  You can check off goals as you achieve them and see the end growing nearer.</li>
