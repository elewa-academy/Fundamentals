## 1. First Interview

Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their programming ambitions.  Ask questions about: 
* Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
* Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
* Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
* And much more!  Listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

### Notes

Notes you took during the interview.

### Summary

Consolidate your notes into a few sentences.  Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them.

Update your notes accordingly

## 4. Define the Problem

In your own words describe:
1. Why your partner needs this portfolio 
2. How they want to be represented
3. How their audience will interact with the portfolio
4. What will it need to have / be like

A useful format:
> _partner's name_ needs a way to _?_.
> Unexpectedly, in their world, _?_.

## 5. Open-Ended Ideation

With no regard to your programming ability, time constraints, technical constraints, or any other practical concern sketch up a few ideas for your partner's portfolio.  Be sure to include user interactions: are there hovers? modals? parallax?


You can use Wireframe.cc, Sketchboard.io, pencile/paper/camera, ...  Just be sure to include samples of your sketches in your repository as links or embedded images.

___

## 6. Partner Feedback

Show and explain your ideas to your partner.  Carefully note their reactions and feedback.

___

## 7. Final Plan

Using your previous demos and partner feedback, write a full development plan for their portfolio.  This plan will take the same format as the _Organizing Development_ project.  Complete the [README from last project's template](https://github.com/elewa-academy/User-Centered-Template), include it in this repository, and link to it from this section.

___

## 8. Final Build

Create a mock-up of the "finished portfolio".  This will be a more detailed mock-up than you used for wireframes or your first round of ideation.  It will include color, images, and finished text.

While you do not need to code the portfolio, there should be enough detail that you or your partner would be able build the portfolio without needing to ask each other any questions.

If you did a good job, your partner will want you to finish building it!


[TOP](#steps)

___

## 9. Final Feedback

The Design Process is never finished!

After you've finished the Final Plan & Final Build ask your partner for feedback.  In a professional setting this would be the beginning of a whole new development cycle.
