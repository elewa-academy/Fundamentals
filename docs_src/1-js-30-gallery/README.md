# Consolidate Practical JavaScript


For the precourse you completed 8+ projects from the JavaScript 30 and featured each one on your portfolio.  This means your portfolio is already pretty crowded, and we haven't even started!  In this code along we will do two things.  
1. Consolidate your separate JS 30 solutions into a single landing page
2. Update your portfolio to feature only this consolidated project instead of 8 separate JS 30 Challenges.

## Study Plan

1. Take a look at the [Elewa Student portfolio](https://elewa-student.github.io/) and [GitHub account](https://github.com/elewa-student) to see how we've organized the JS 30 Landing Page.
2. Install Mobirise & Build a Landing page that features the source and demo for each JS 30 challenge you completed. 
3. Save the code, write a README, push it to a new repo on your GitHub account.
4. Update your portfolio to include only this project and not each individual challenge.

## Resources

* Example:  [Landing Page](https://elewa-student.github.io/JS-30-Landing-Page), [Repository](https://github.com/elewa-student/JS-30-Landing-Page), [Updated Portfolio](https://elewa-student.github.io)
* [Mobirise Beginner's Guide](https://mobirise.com/help/easy-website-builder-mobirise-beginner-guide-163.html).  They say you can push your project directly to Gh-Pages, but don't bother with that.  It's glitchy.  And you'll need to save your code to your computer to write a README anyway.
